                Please feel free to use these free and open DNS servers powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a>. They are running a pretty vanilla install with the default blocklists; the only notable exception is that they are also blocking all .cn and .ru domains. The Query Log is disabled and the software is running in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/privacylevels/#level-3-anonymous-mode-anonymize-everything">Anonymous Mode</a>.

                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Why are you doing this?</b><br>
                    Not everyone knows how to setup Pi-Hole or wants to run their own server. But most people hate internet advertising in its current form. This is my small contribution to humanity and a better internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>2. How long will you run this?</b><br>
                    For as long as I can afford it. If this website is up then the DNS servers are up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>3. How do I know you aren't logging anything or collecting data?</b><br>
                    Here is my <a target="_blank" href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. You'll have to take my word for it. Eventually, I'd love to undergo regular auditing by a third party.

                    <b>5. How do I use this?</b><br>
                    <i>I'll make this better soon...</i><br>
                    You should do it on your router. I would suggest looking under the DHCP settings on your router and find the setting to modify the DNS servers that are set by DHCP. If you'd like to do it just on your computer: <a target="_blank" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=change+dns+server+windows+10&s=d">Windows 10</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=change+dns+server+macos&s=d">macOS</a>.

                    <b>6. Does using this mean my internet activity will be anonymous?</b><br>
                    No. This simply helps block some internet advertising. It will also block all .cn (China) and .ru (Russia) domains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>7. What is your upstream DNS provider?</b><br>
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/">CloudFlare - 1.1.1.1</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>8. Where are the servers located?</b><br>
                    In the USA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>9. Can I tell my friends and family?</b><br>
                    Yes please. I would consider this to be in beta currently so share it with your nerdier friends and family first.
