        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p>
            <b>1. Why are you doing this?</b><br>
            Not everyone knows how to setup something like Pi-Hole or wants to run their own DNS servers. But most
            people hate internet advertising and privacy abuse. This is my small contribution to humanity and a better
            internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. How long will you run this?</b><br>
            For as long as I can afford it. If this website is up then the DNS servers are up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. How do I know you aren't logging anything or collecting data?</b><br>
            The Query Log is disabled and the Pi-Hole software is running in <a target="_blank"
                href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/privacylevels/#level-3-anonymous-mode-anonymize-everything">Anonymous
                Mode</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a>, the local
            recursive DNS server running, is <a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/irlrobot/p4a/blob/master/unbound.conf">configured to not log any queries</a>. I
            respect your <a target="_blank" href="privacy.html">privacy</a> and believe everyone else should too.
            Eventually I'd love to undergo regular auditing by a third party but for now you'll have to take my word for
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4. Does using these DNS servers mean my internet activity will be anonymous?</b><br>
            Using these DNS servers does not guarantee your anonyminity on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>5. What blocklists, blacklists, and whitelists are being used?</b><br>
            Here are the <a target="_blank" href="blocklists.txt">blocklists</a> I use (Pi-Hole defaults), my <a
                target="_blank" href="blacklist.txt">blacklist</a> that includes common tracking/advertising
            (sub)domains and the entirety of .cn (China) and .ru (Russia), and my <a target="_blank"
                href="whitelist.txt">whitelist</a> which I update when I notice things breaking. This setup blocks
            enough garbage while not being overzealous.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>6. Where are the servers located?</b><br>
            In the USA. No plans to expand at this time, sorry.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>7. Are there any restrictions on queries?</b><br>
            Queries that are known to be used for abuse and that are rarely made with normal internet use are dropped.
            Rate limiting is in place but anyone using this service legitmately should never know it. If you are a
            security researcher with suggestions or knowledge of something exploitable <a
