                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Why are you doing this?</b><br>
                    Not everyone knows how to setup Pi-Hole or wants to run their own server. But most people hate internet advertising in its current form. This is my small contribution to humanity and a better internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>2. How long will you run this?</b><br>
                    For as long as I can afford it. If this website is up then the DNS servers are up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>3. How do I know you aren't logging anything or collecting data?</b><br>
                    The Query Log is disabled and the software is running in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/privacylevels/#level-3-anonymous-mode-anonymize-everything">Anonymous Mode</a>. I respect your <a target="_blank" href="privacy.html">privacy</a> and believe everyone else should too. You'll have to take my word for it, but eventually I'd love to undergo regular auditing by a third party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>4. How do I contact you?</b><br>
                    <a href="mailto:josh@p4a.net">josh@p4a.net</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>5. How do I use this?</b><br>
                    <i>I'll make this better soon...</i><br>
                    You should do it on your router. I would suggest looking under the DHCP settings on your router and find the option to modify the DNS servers that are set by DHCP. If you'd like to do it just on your computer: <a target="_blank" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=change+dns+server+windows+10&s=d">Windows 10</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=change+dns+server+macos&s=d">macOS</a>.

                <p>
                    <b>6. Does using this mean my internet activity will be anonymous?</b><br>
                    No, this simply helps block some internet advertising. It will also block all .cn (China) and .ru (Russia) domains. Using these DNS servers does not guarantee your anonyminity of the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>7. What blocklists and blacklists/filters are being used?</b><br>
                    I am using the default <a target="_blank" href="blocklists.txt">Pi-Hole blocklists</a>. I have added additional <a target="_blank" href="filters.txt">filters</a> that includes common tracking/advertising domains and the entirety of .cn (China) and .ru (Russia). <a href="mailto:josh@p4a.net">Contact me</a> if you have a suggestion, I plan to add an upvote/downvote feature in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>8. Where are the servers located?</b><br>
                    In the USA. No plans to expand at this time, sorry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>9. Are there any restrictions on queries?</b><br>
                    Queries that are known to be used for abuse and that are rarely made with normal internet use are dropped. Rate limiting is in place but anyone using this service legitmately should never know it. If you are a security researcher with suggestions or knowledge of something exploitable <a href="mailto:josh@p4a.net">please contact me</a>.
