                Please feel free to use this free and open DNS server powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a>. It is running a pretty vanilla install with the default blocklists; the only notable exception is that it is also blocking all .cn and .ru domains. The Query Log is disabled and the software is running in <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/privacylevels/#level-3-anonymous-mode-anonymize-everything">Anonymous Mode</a>.

                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Why are you doing this?</b><br>
                    Not everyone knows how to setup Pi-Hole or wants to run their own server. But most people hate internet advertising in its current form. This is my small contribution to humanity and a better internet.

                <p>
                    <b>2. How long will you run this?</b><br>
                    For as long as I can afford it.

                <p>
                    <b>3. How do I know you aren't logging anything or collecting data?</b><br>
                    Here is my <a target="_blank" href="privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. You'll have to take my word for it. Eventually, I'd love to undergo regular auditing by a third party.

                    <b>4. What is your upstream DNS provider?</b><br>
                    CloudFlare - 1.1.1.1
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>5. How do I contact you?</b><br>

                <p>
                    <b>6. How do I use this?</b><br>
                    <i>I'll make this better one day I promise...</i><br>
                    You should do it on your router. I would suggest looking under the DHCP settings on your router and find the setting to modify the DNS servers that are set. If you'd like to do it just on your computer: <a target="_blank" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=change+dns+server+windows+10&s=d">Windows 10</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=change+dns+server+macos&s=d">macOS</a>.

                <p>
                    <b>7. Only one server?</b><br>
                    Yes for now. I want to see what the costs are like with just one. I would recommend using 1.1.1.1 as your secondary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>8. Can I tell my friends and family?</b><br>
                    Yes please. I would consider this to be in beta currently so share it with your nerdier friends and family first.
